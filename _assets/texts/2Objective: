The objectives of this two part disjoint experiment series will be to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Study Electron Spin Resonance spectra for a given sample, and explain the number, and position of peaks
\item
  Perform experiments with the ExpEyes system, one being studying the induced voltage when a small magnet is dropped through a coil, and the other being looking at how the voltage pulses when a led at a particular frequency is shown to a photodiode
\end{itemize}
