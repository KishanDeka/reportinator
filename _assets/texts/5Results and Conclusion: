We see that experiments turned out to be as expected, I estimate the magnetic moment to be 1.6 A.m$^2$. Substituting: P = 5, $\nu = 14.37 \times 10^6 Hz$ and slope = 0.195 in eq \ref{eq} we also get $g = 1.565$, which is pretty close to it's actual value.
\section{Precautions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Care must be taken and the knobs adjusted to keep the phase zero at each change in current for ESR
	\item The magnet must be dropped as vertically as possible
\end{itemize}
