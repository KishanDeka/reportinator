# Aim of the Project:
To make LaTeX reports easily from markdowns, containing the section data and marked CSVs. Current implementation spits out the LaTeX code into `stdout`. **!! This project is in no way complete in its current state, please do not expect a lot !!**. I am working on making this project cross platform, it will soon be. Please look around first, before doing anything.

## Clone this repository:
```shell
git clone "https://github.com/spandananupam/reportinator"
```

## Basic Usage:
You can edit the basic configurations in `meta.csv`. The whole code is activated in `_scripts/` by:
```shell
python3 main.py --source path/to/source/directory
```

## Dependencies:
For the sake of this project, these packages/programs have to be installed:
* Python 3.7 onwards
* LaTeX
* Pandas
* Pandoc (Native pandoc installation and python-pip pypandoc installation both are needed.)
```shell
pip3 install pypandoc
```
* pandoc-xnos installation: [install xnos](https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-xnos/#Installation)

If there are any problems, please check if your python versions are correct.

## File Structure:
`input.md` is the Input markdown (Please look at the example given by default)

`meta.csv` is the metadata required for each report.

`_assets` contains csv files, images, and files that are being processed.
* `csvs` contains all the csv files (Please look at the example given by default)
* `process` and `texts` are to be ignored by the average user

`_scripts` contains all the code. If you want a custom code to run in a particular section, you need to keep your script with the name same as the the name of the section.

`_old` is to be ignored

`_layouts` contains all the .cls files for LaTeX

`tex_out` is supposed to be the processing place for everything .tex.

## Input Markdown:
The name of the input markdown is the title of the report. Please do not use ":" at the end of your main headings.

The input markdown takes everything into LaTeX with the help of `pandoc`. Due to this, there are certain rules that have to be followed to prevent errors in the final output.
Recommended use: Typora, as a markdown editor, otherwise:

For recognizing multiple subsections, or lists with a text above them, it is necessary that you leave a one line gap between each subsection, or before the list. There is an example loaded in the current repo, which may be referred to, initially.
**Tables and Graphs will only be plotted only if the program sees the appropriate section headings.** If you are leaving some section like graphs blank, and want to only fill it up with python graphs, you need to leave one blank line in the section. That is, you must have atleast one line in each section, even if it is blank.

### Equations:
For putting in equations, you must type:
```markdown
$$ your-equation $$ {#eq:tag}
```
For referencing them anywhere inside the text, you just need to type `@eq:tag` or `{@eq:tag}` at the appropriate place.

### Images:
Example for inserting images into the markdown:
```markdown
image(name.png)
```
Refer to these images by saying {@fig:name} in-text.

### Tables:
Tables are made from csvs placed in `_assets/csvs/`. All the csv files placed here will be converted to tables. For good looking reports, please make sure that there are a maximum of 4 columns.

### Graphs:
Graphs are made from csv files placed in `_assets/csvs/`. These are triggered by a graph statement at the end of the csvfile. They need to be in the first cell of the last row of the csvfile in a specific format.
```
graph(x,y,x,y..)
```
Where x,y pairs are column pairs that need to be plotted. Without this tag at the end of the csv, the table will only be passed as a table, and not into graphs.

## Templates
This code supports templates. All the class files are to be stored in `_layouts/`. Please add these lines to your custom class file, after `\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}`:
```latex
 \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
 \usepackage{times}
 \usepackage{graphicx}
 \usepackage{amssymb}
 \usepackage{textcomp}
 \usepackage{gensymb}
 \usepackage{amsmath}
 \usepackage{float}
 \usepackage{booktabs}
 \usepackage[table,xcdraw]{xcolor}
 \providecommand{\tightlist}{%
   \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}}
```
The graph python code uses seaborn, you may look at the different styles available in the internet for the same, and change it in `_scripts/figures.py`

# To do:
* Fitting in the graph
* All in one code for running the python script, and outputting into a tex file, and compiling.

# Example:
One example has been loaded by default into this program. Please see it, before erasing out anything.
